## Mathematical Framework for Modeling Consciousness

This code uses my Mathematical Framework for Modeling Consciousness and puts it into code.

### Steps

#### The first step is Bayes Inference:
![Bayes' Theorem](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P(H|E)%20=%20\frac{P(E|H)%20\cdot%20P(H)}{P(E)})

#### The second step is Fuzzy Logic:
Fuzzy Sets = based on P(H|E)
